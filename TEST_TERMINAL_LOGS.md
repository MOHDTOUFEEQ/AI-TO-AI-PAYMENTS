---

### Step 6: Terminal Interactions

#### Test Auto-Scroll

1. While logs are flowing:
    - [ ] Terminal automatically scrolls to bottom
    - [ ] Latest logs always visible
2. Manually scroll up
    - [ ] Can view earlier logs
    - [ ] New logs still arrive (check bottom)
3. Scroll back to bottom
    - [ ] Auto-scroll resumes

#### Test Clear Logs

1. Click clear button (trash icon)

    - [ ] Entry count resets to "0 entries"
    - [ ] No console errors

#### Test Connection Resilience

1. Stop orchestrator (Ctrl+C in Terminal 1)
    - [ ] Connection indicator changes to "üî¥ OFFLINE"
    - [ ] Red static dot (no pulsing)
2. Restart orchestrator (`npm start`)
    - [ ] Connection indicator returns to "üü¢ LIVE"
    - [ ] Green pulsing dot
    - [ ] Auto-reconnects within 3-5 seconds

---

### Step 7: Multiple Requests

#### Submit Second Request

1. Clear logs (for clean slate)
2. Submit another video request with different prompt
3. Watch logs flow again

**Verify:**

-   [ ] New request ID (incremented)
-   [ ] All phases work again
-   [ ] No interference with previous request
-   [ ] Terminal handles it smoothly

#### Parallel Requests (Advanced)

1. Open frontend in two different browser tabs
2. Submit requests from both simultaneously

**Verify:**

-   [ ] Both terminals show logs
-   [ ] Logs are interleaved correctly
-   [ ] No log entries lost
-   [ ] Both connections stable

---

### Step 8: Mobile Testing

#### Resize Browser Window

1. Make window narrow (< 768px)

    - [ ] Layout switches to single column
    - [ ] Form appears above terminal
    - [ ] Terminal still fully functional
    - [ ] All controls work

2. Tablet size (768px - 1024px)
    - [ ] Two-column layout maintained
    - [ ] Terminal not sticky (scrolls with page)

---

### Step 9: Error Handling

#### Test Network Errors

1. Disconnect from internet

    - [ ] Connection indicator shows OFFLINE
    - [ ] No crashes or console errors

2. Reconnect internet
    - [ ] Connection restores automatically
    - [ ] Shows LIVE again

#### Test Invalid Transactions

1. Submit request with insufficient ETH

    - [ ] MetaMask shows error
    - [ ] No logs appear (request never submitted)
    - [ ] Terminal still functional

2. Reject transaction in MetaMask
    - [ ] Toast shows error
    - [ ] No logs appear
    - [ ] Can submit again

---

### Step 10: Browser Console Check

Open DevTools ‚Üí Console

**Should NOT see:**

-   ‚ùå React errors
-   ‚ùå Network errors (except expected failures)
-   ‚ùå TypeScript errors
-   ‚ùå CORS errors
-   ‚ùå EventSource errors

**Should see:**

-   ‚úÖ "Connected to orchestrator log stream"
-   ‚úÖ Parsed log objects (if you log them)

---

### Step 11: Network Tab Check

Open DevTools ‚Üí Network

#### Filter by "EventStream"

-   [ ] Connection to `/api/logs/stream` visible
-   [ ] Status: "200 OK"
-   [ ] Type: "eventsource"
-   [ ] Size: Gradually increasing (log data)
-   [ ] Time: Ongoing (long-running connection)

#### Check Headers

-   [ ] `Content-Type: text/event-stream`
-   [ ] `Cache-Control: no-cache`
-   [ ] `Connection: keep-alive`
